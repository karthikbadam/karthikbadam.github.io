        I am a fourth year <span style='background-color:#f0e8ff'>PhD candidate</span> in the Department of Computer Science at <span style='background-color:#f0e8ff'>University of Maryland</span> in College Park, MD, USA. I am very  privileged to work with <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.umiacs.umd.edu/elm/" class="textlink"><span style='background-color:#f0e8ff'><u>Dr. Niklas Elmqvist</u></span></a>. I am interested in <span style='background-color:#f0e8ff'>data visualization</span>, visual analytics, and HCI in general. My research encompasses these fields and more specifically explores novel interaction devices for <span style='background-color:#f0e8ff'>collaborative visual data analysis</span>. I am also working on other areas in these fields as listed in my <a target="_blank" href="https://karthikbadam.github.io/projects/" class="textlink"><u>projects</u></a>. I received my Master of Science in electrical and computer engineering in 2014 from Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN, USA. My Masters thesis involved developing <span style='background-color:#f0e8ff'>digital media platforms for early design</span>. I enjoy playing tennis, rock climbing, and sketching in my spare time.

        Before my graduate life, I received my Bachelors degree in computer science in 2012 from Indian Institute of Technology in Hyderabad, India. At that time, I developed Android mobile applications to support rescue and recovery operations in post-disaster situations through a novel multi-hop, peer-to-peer synchronization protocol. This was part of DISANET---Information Network for Natural Disaster Mitigation and Recovery---a joint research project between India and Japan on the use of information and communications technology to mitigate the after-effects of natural disasters.
