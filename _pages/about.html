        I am now a data scientist at Apple. I build analytical tools that help understand, explore, and explain the usage of ï£¿ Siri. Before this, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Maryland in College Park, MD, USA. I am interested in <span style='background-color:#f0e8ff'>data visualization</span>, visual analytics, and HCI in general. I also received my Master of Science in electrical and computer engineering in 2014 from Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN, USA. I enjoy playing tennis, rock climbing, and sketching in my spare time.

        Few years ago, I received my Bachelors degree in computer science in 2012 from Indian Institute of Technology in Hyderabad, India. At that time, I developed Android mobile applications to support rescue and recovery operations in post-disaster situations through a novel multi-hop, peer-to-peer synchronization protocol. This was part of DISANET---Information Network for Natural Disaster Mitigation and Recovery---a joint research project between India and Japan on the use of information and communications technology to mitigate the after-effects of natural disasters.
