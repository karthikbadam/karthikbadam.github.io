    <h3>INST760 - Data Visualization - Fall 2017</h3>
    <div style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 30px; line-height: 1.5">
        I am currently teaching Data Visualization in iSchool, UMD.
        This is a project-oriented course covering topics in data visualization including perception and cognition, data representations and transformations, visual representations for specific data types, and interaction techniques for visual analysis.
        Projects done in this course have the potential of leading to research publications and form the basis of a master's thesis or a Ph.D. research topic.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This course happens on Thursdays 2pm - 5pm (HBK 0115) and is being taken by 31 graduate students.

    <h3>INST728Q - Visual Analytics - Spring 2017</h3>

    <div style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 30px; line-height: 1.5">

        I taught a special topics course on Visual Analytics in iSchool, UMD in Spring 2017.
        Visual analytics is the use of interactive visual interfaces to facilitate analytical reasoning.
        In essence, visual analytics is based on the idea that humans and computers working alone are insufficient for
        the data challenges of today and tomorrow, and that effective synthesis of both humans and computational
        algorithms are needed to create human-in-the-loop systems.
        Thus, visual analytics bridges human-centered disciplines such as visualization and human-computer interaction
        with computation-centered disciplines such as machine learning, probabilistic methods, and knowledge discovery.

    <div style="font-size: 14px; padding-left: 30px; line-height: 1.5">
        <br/>
        This course covers topics related to:
        <ul>
            <li> Human aspects such as perception, cognition, sensemaking, critical thinking, and the analytical
                process.
            </li>
            <li> Computational aspects such as data management, data transformations, knowledge representation,
                probabilistic methods, and text analytics, etc.
            </li>
            <li> Integration of knowledge from fields such as visualization, human-computer interaction, machine
                learning, knowledge discovery, and text analytics towards helping people understand data.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The course was taken by 24 graduate students.
        <!--and happens on Thursdays at 2:00pm to 4:45pm in HBK 0109.-->
